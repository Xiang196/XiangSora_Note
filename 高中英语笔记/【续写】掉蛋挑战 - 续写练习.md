OK, everybody. It's that time of year, said my science teacher, Mr. Beal. This Friday we'll have the annual Egg Drop Challenge. Bring your best containers to class. You can work alone or work together.”
 
Mr. Beal's fifth grade Egg Drop Challenge was an institution at my school. The goal of the Challenge was simple - you had to build a protective container to keep an egg from breaking when dropped over the stadium wall.
 
My best friend, Cassie, and I grinned at each other. We always worked on projects together. She's brainy; I'm creative. We're the perfect combination, like peanut butter and marshmallow (棉花糖霜) cream, which happens to be my favorite kind of sandwich.
 
I made my favorite sandwich that afternoon while waiting for Cassie to come over and work on the container. Spreading the fluffy marshmallow cream gave me an idea.
 
“I have a brilliant design for our egg container!” I said when Cassie arrived. She looked at me eagerly. “We can cushion it with some marshmallow cream. You know, to absorb the shock of the impact,” I explained. “You've got to be kidding,” Cassie exclaimed. “You have a better idea?” Cassie pointed to a sketch (草图) in her notebook. “Actually I do. We put the egg in a basket with parachute (降落伞) attached. It will simply float to safety.” “It's too easy for something to go wrong. It will never work!” I said. Cassie rolled her eyes, “The parachute is better than that stupid idea.”
 
I couldn't believe it. Of course we'd had our little fights in the past, but this was different. She'd never called any of my ideas “stupid” before. “Then I'll build mine and you build yours, and we'll just see whose is better.” “Fine!” Cassie threw her notebook into her backpack and stormed out. And just like that, our friendship was broken. Like an egg dropped from the top of a stadium without marshmallow cream to protect it.

*Para. 1 When Friday finally came, I had to admit that Cassie's Egg Force One looked pretty good.*
*Para. 2 By the fourth round, only Cassie and I were left.*


*When Friday finally came, I had to admit that Cassie's Egg Force One looked pretty good*. ==But I wasn't worried. My marshmallow design had its own charm. ==<sub>取消“放狠话”，直奔主题</sub>. Cassie and I stood at the edge of the roof, watching our containers fall through the air. ==Her parachute gracefully floated in the air, and landed on the ground with a perfect descent. Meanwhile, though my container tumbled and bounced on the ground, the marshmallow inside protected the egg from the shock.==<sub>加入对"我"和Cassie的容器的描写</sub> Our containers survived the first round, the second and the third, while others cracked on the ground, announcing their failure.
 
*By the fourth round, only Cassie and I were left*. As the students below the stadium waited excitedly for the final match, we released our containers. Everyone hushed in anticipation when the containers landed."TIE!!!" Shouted the judge, and the crowd erupted in surprise. ==Our eggs had both survived, ==<sub>换个好结局（）</sub> but it was clear that our designs were more than just creative—they were a reflection of who we were,which also showed that both of us won the game. In that moment, I realized that sometimes, ==winning isn’t about being the best, it’s about recognizing the value of what we bring to the table==<sub>尝试升华？</sub>. Cassie and I exchanged a smile. ==“Next time, let's combine our designs.”==<sub>对未来的展望更积极</sub> she said. And just like that, our friendship was mended, like an egg equipped with a parachute, gently landing on a fluffy marshmallow—safe, sound, and whole.
