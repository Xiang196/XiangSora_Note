阅读下面材料，根据其内容和所给段落开头语续写两段，使之构成一篇完整的短文。
```Lily loved fixing things. Her father, a mechanic, had taught her to repair radios and toys before he passed away three years ago. Now, she spent weekends working on old machines in her small bedroom, finding comfort in the rhythms of tools and gears (齿轮). At school, however, she stayed quiet. Her clothes, worn and faded, made her an easy target for jokes.Emma, the smart but mean girl, often singled her out.
One afternoon, while cleaning the science lab, Lily accidentally knocked over Emma’s model rocket, shattering it on the floor. The room went silent before Emma sneered, “Nice job, Junkyard Girl. Maybe you should stick to fixing trash instead of real projects.” The class burst into laughter. Red - faced and humiliated, Lily rushed out, locked herself in the bathroom, and fought back tears.
Two weeks later, their teacher announced a robotics competition. “You’ll work in pairs to build a robot that can go over obstacles like climbing stairs, crossing bridges, and avoiding blocks, before reaching the destination,” he said, with excitement in his voice. Lily’s stomach twisted as her eyes scanned the list of names. Her worst fear had come true: her partner was Emma.
"Great. Now I have to do all the work," Emma muttered under her breath when she saw the pairing. She slumped in her seat, clearly uninterested.
Emma started to make her - own robot and never showed up for their meetings. Lily, determined not to let the project fall apart, worked alone, sketching designs after school in the quiet of the lab.
One evening, as Lily worked late into the night, she noticed Emma ’s robot sitting abandoned in the corner of the lab. She glanced at it and froze. The wires were connected dangerously wrong—it could explode if turned on. Just as Lily reached to inspect the robot, the door creaked open.
```
*Paragraph 1：Emma stood frozen in the doorway, her eyes widening at the scene.*
*Paragraph 2 On competition day, Emma and Lily presented a robot engraved with their names.*

Paragraph 1
 
Emma stood frozen in the doorway, her eyes widening at the scene. "What are you doing to my robot?!" Yelling in fury, Emma rushed to her robot, like a tornado sweeping on the floor. Lily, stunned at the moment, took a tiny step back, grabbing the sketch in her sweating hand more tightly. As soon as Emma reached the start button, a thin arm denied her. "There're problems in your wiring..." Frightened, Lily stopped Emma with great determination. After patiently fixing the mistakes with Emma, Lily presented her sketch. Even Emma let out praises after reading it. "Let's complete it together." They chorused. The next few nights witnessed their hard work for the project. After the final polishing, the robot was finished!

Paragraph 2
 
On competition day, Emma and Lily presented a robot engraved with their names. "Ready? — Start!" the judge claimed. The start button turned green under their fingers. "Nothing can stop our robots!" Emma exclaimed, excitedly grabbing Lily's hands. The robot, elegantly crossing the bridge, was reaching the destination! "We did it!" They cheered together, watching their little robot bow to the audiences as an ending. At that moment, Emma turned to Lily and sincerely apologized for misunderstanding her. Lily softly smiled and gave her a hug in response. Bright sunlight made the robot shine. Each clunk - clunk of the gears was like the bell of happiness, ringing and blessing for their friendship.

---

### **优点：**  
1. **情节紧凑**：从冲突到合作再到比赛胜利，节奏明快，符合续写要求。  
2. **人物互动生动**：Emma的愤怒到合作，再到最后的道歉，转变自然。  
3. **细节描写**：比如"grabbing the sketch in her sweating hand"和"clunk-clunk of the gears"，增强了画面感。  
4. **主题呼应**：友谊的修复和机器人比赛的成功结合得很好。  

---

### **建议修改的地方：**  

#### **Paragraph 1 修改建议：**  
1. **Emma的反应可以更细腻**：  
   - 原文中Emma直接"yelling in fury"，可以稍微铺垫她的情绪变化，比如先震惊，再愤怒，最后被Lily的专业说服。  
   - 例如：  
     > *Emma stood frozen in the doorway, her eyes widening at the scene. "What are you doing to my robot?" she demanded, voice sharp with suspicion. But as she rushed forward, Lily blocked her path, her own hands trembling but firm. "Wait—your wiring’s wrong," Lily insisted, pointing to the dangerously crossed circuits. Emma’s anger faltered as she peered closer, her face paling at the potential disaster.*  

2. **合作过程可以更具体**：  
   - 原文"After patiently fixing the mistakes with Emma"可以稍微展开，比如：  
     > *Lily carefully explained the errors, her fingers deftly rearranging the wires. Emma, though initially reluctant, found herself nodding along. "Your sketch is... actually really good," Emma admitted grudgingly, eyeing Lily’s design. A hesitant smile tugged at Lily’s lips. "Then let’s combine our ideas."*  

#### **Paragraph 2 修改建议：**  
1. **比赛过程可以更生动**：  
   - 原文的机器人动作（"elegantly crossing the bridge"）可以加点细节，比如：  
     > *Their robot moved with precision, its customized treads gripping the stairs effortlessly. When it reached the bridge, a sensor adjustment—Lily’s touch—kept it perfectly balanced. The audience gasped as it cleared the final obstacle, its tiny LED blinking in triumph.*  

2. **Emma的道歉可以更自然**：  
   - 原文的道歉稍显突兀，可以加一点铺垫，比如：  
     > *As the crowd cheered, Emma’s grip on Lily’s hand tightened. "I... I owe you an apology," she muttered, barely audible over the noise. "For everything." Lily’s smile was warm, her earlier shyness gone. "We make a good team," she replied simply.*  

3. **结尾的比喻可以更简洁**：  
   - "Each clunk-clunk of the gears was like the bell of happiness" 可以稍微调整，让比喻更自然：  
     > *The robot’s gears hummed softly, a steady rhythm that seemed to echo their newfound friendship. Outside, the sunlight glinted off its metal frame, casting tiny, dancing reflections across the room.*

### **修改后的版本（仅供参考）：**  

**Paragraph 1:**  
Emma stood frozen in the doorway, her eyes widening at the scene. "What are you doing to my robot?" she demanded, voice sharp with suspicion. But as she rushed forward, Lily blocked her path, her own hands trembling but firm. "Wait—your wiring’s wrong," Lily insisted, pointing to the dangerously crossed circuits. Emma’s anger faltered as she peered closer, her face paling at the potential disaster. Swallowing her pride, she watched silently as Lily carefully rearranged the wires. "Your sketch is... actually really good," Emma admitted grudgingly, eyeing Lily’s design. A hesitant smile tugged at Lily’s lips. "Then let’s combine our ideas."  

**Paragraph 2:**  
On competition day, Emma and Lily presented a robot engraved with their names. The moment the judge signaled the start, their creation sprang to life, its movements precise. It climbed stairs with Emma’s lightweight frame and adjusted sensors with Lily’s reprogrammed code. When it cleared the final obstacle, the crowd erupted in applause. As the cheers faded, Emma turned to Lily, her usual smirk replaced by something softer. "I... I owe you an apology," she muttered. "For everything." Lily’s smile was warm. "We make a good team," she replied simply. The robot’s gears hummed softly, a steady rhythm that seemed to echo their newfound friendship.

### **总结：**  
你的续写已经很不错，只需要在**情感过渡**和**细节描写**上稍微打磨，让故事更流畅自然。  
- **Emma的情绪**：从愤怒→震惊→合作→真诚道歉，可以更细腻。  
- **比赛过程**：加点技术细节（如传感器、齿轮声）会让故事更真实。  
- **结尾比喻**：可以更简洁，避免过于直白的抒情。

### **修改后的版本（对比参考）：**  
**Paragraph 2 (优化后):**  
*On competition day, the gym buzzed with nervous energy. Emma and Lily stood side by side, their robot—now polished and engraved with both names—gleaming under the spotlights. "Contestants, ready?" the judge called. "Three, two, one—start!" Lily’s finger hovered over the button, but Emma nudged her. "Together," she whispered. The screen flashed green, and their robot sprang to life. It climbed the stairs with mechanical precision, its treads gripping tightly. When it balanced perfectly on the narrow bridge, the crowd held their breath—then erupted as it zoomed past the finish line. "We did it!" Lily gasped. Emma impulsively pulled her into a bear hug, then suddenly stiffened. "I... I guess I owe you an apology," she mumbled. "For the rocket. And the trash talk. And—" Lily’s chest warmed.

### **🌟 优化目标总结：**  
1. **比赛流程真实感**：用具体动作（如"balanced on the bridge"）替代概括性描述（如"elegantly crossing"）。  
2. **情感自然过渡**：通过小动作（如Emma"scuffing her shoe"）和碎片化对话展现道歉。  
3. **避免机械降神**：删去机器人突然"bow"的设定，改用已铺垫的功能（如传感器触发）。  
4. **结尾象征意义**：用"gears hummed"呼应前文，比喻修复的友谊，而非强行抒情。  

---

### **💡 终极技巧：**  
- **"Show, don’t tell"**：用动作和环境暗示情感（如"Emma’s sharp edges seemed softer"）。  
- **伏笔回收**：前文提到Lily擅长修理，结尾可用机器人"humming"象征她的成长。
