In the quaint town of Willowbrook, a young boy named Oliver found joy in painting. It was an art that he had inherited from his grandmother, a talented painter herself, who had taught him the magic of colors and the beauty of creativity. She had passed away when Oliver was still young, but her love for painting had left an indelible mark on him.
 
One sunny afternoon in art class, while his teacher went on and on about the importance of shading, Oliver couldn't help but let his imagination take flight. He pulled out his well-worn sketchbook, its pages filled with countless sketches and half-finished ideas, and began to draw. His pencil danced across the paper, giving life to a majestic dragon, which soared through a sky filled with swirling clouds.
 
"Hey, Oliver! What are you doing?" a voice called out from behind him. It was Jake, one of the popular kids in class. Oliver glanced up, heart racing as he realized he had been caught.
 
"Just... uh, doodling(乱涂乱画)," he stammered, trying to hide his drawing.
 
Jake leaned closer, peering over Oliver's shoulder. "Doodling? Looks more like a waste of time to me!" he laughed, and soon the other kids joined in, their laughter ringing in Oliver's ears.
 
"Yeah, why don't you focus on something important, like math?" another classmate chimed in(插话), smirking.
 
Feeling embarrassed and hurt, Oliver's cheeks flushed red. He quickly closed his sketchbook, wishing he could disappear. The joy he had felt just moments before was replaced by a heavy weight in his chest. "Maybe they're right," he thought, fighting back tears. "Maybe painting really is just a silly hobby."
 
That day, as he walked home, Oliver felt a deep sense of loss. The paintbrushes that once brought him peace now felt like a burden. He made a decision in that moment: he would put them away forever.
