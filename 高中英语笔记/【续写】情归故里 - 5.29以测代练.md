```
Final exams were approaching, and everyone in school was excited about vacations. We were dreaming of far - off destinations, our minds filled with images of thrilling adventures.
After school on Friday, on my way home, I ran into my best friend. Enthusiastic about the vacations, I asked him about his plans. His eyes twinkled brightly as he replied, “I’m going to visit my grandparents with my parents for a week.”
“Don’t you ever get tired of going to the same place year after year? I remember, every year, your family takes 7 to 10 days off to head back to your native village,” I asked, raising an eyebrow in curiosity.
“Oh, not at all! That’s the absolute best time of the year for me! Being with my folks in the village is just amazing.” His face beamed with joy as he continued, "In the village, I get to meet so many wonderful people, and everyone there is so kind and welcoming. Our neighborhood crew is tight! We’re always hanging out together, you know? Just running wild, chilling by the lake, or bouncing between each other’s houses. Honestly, I know what really matters about these village trips. It’s not the cool places we see — it’s spending time with the people I love. That’s the real treasure of life.”
His words made me recall my own grandparents. I realized I hadn’t seen them for years. But still, it’s a pleasure to be there. ... we had big long gardens and a big multi - story house.
The next day, over breakfast, I mustered up the courage and asked my parents, “Can we visit grandparents this summer after exams?” Dad replied hesitantly, “Oh, that’s unexpected.” Mom was surprised. “Well, you know it gets really hot there this time of year.” After a short pause, Dad gave a small sigh and met my hopeful gaze. “However,” he said, “if you perform well in exams, we’ll make the trip.”
For the next six weeks, I threw myself completely into my studies. My mom was amazed by this sudden transformation in me. Soon came the long - awaited exam results.
```

Para 1: I rushed home and immediately handed my parents my score card and a note with “PLEASE.”
Para 2: I saw my mom had tears in her eyes when leaving them.

I rushed home and immediately handed my parents my score card and a note with “PLEASE.” Dad and mom, eye - widened, stared at my score card in amaze and soon turned into complimenting: “Congratulations!” Our delighted gazes met, and without hesitant, we headed toward my grandparents’ house hundreds mile away. Upon arriving, I saw the villagers waiting in distance, while my grandparents standing in the front, cordially chorusing: “Welcome home!” Getting out of the car, we immersed ourselves in the warm reunion. Strolling past the familiar path, the multi - story house, I’m packed with nostalgia. The next weeks witnessed my wonderful village life: farming under the summer sun, hanging out with childhood friends, and having dinner with my family. Time melted in happiness.

I saw my mom had tears in her eyes when leaving them. My dad, forcing himself to wave goodbye with smile, but his watery eyes betrayed him. I felt a lump form in my throat, listening to my grandparents’ farewell and blessing, only able to say thanks and bye. On the train back home, I started to reflect my experiences. “Being with my folks in the village is just amazing.” My friend’s word lingered in my head. In retrospect, I truly spent a period of colorful time in the village, when my grandparents shared my childhood stories with me, when the villagers strolling in the mountains with me. Every person, every pieces of land formed my irreplaceable memory of my grandparents and the village — "That’s the real treasure of the life." I murmured with a smile, responding to my best friend.

### 拆老师之作
**Para 1:**  
I rushed home and immediately handed my parents my score card and a note with “PLEASE.” My heart was pounding as they unfolded the paper. Dad glanced at my grades, then looked up with raised eyebrows. “Wow, impressive!” Mom smiled, clearly surprised. “You really worked hard,” she said, ruffling my hair. After a moment of silent exchange between them, Dad nodded with a grin. “Pack your bags—we’re going.” I couldn’t believe my ears! I jumped up with joy, already imagining the train ride, the countryside breeze, and my grandparents’ warm embrace waiting on the other side.

**Para 2:**  
I saw my mom had tears in her eyes when leaving them. I felt the same—a soft ache in my chest as Grandpa handed me a bag of homemade pickles and Grandma gently pressed a red string bracelet into my hand for good luck. Those ten days had flown by in laughter, stories, and late-night talks under the stars. I had discovered something deeper than adventure: the quiet joy of family, roots, and belonging. As the car pulled away, I waved until they disappeared from sight. I knew now—this wasn’t just a trip. It was a return to something real.

### D老师之作
**Para 1: I rushed home and immediately handed my parents my score card and a note with “PLEASE.”**
Breathless, I shoved my report card and the scribbled “PLEASE” note at my parents. Mom’s eyes darted over the stellar grades first, widening in disbelief. Dad, however, stared intently at the single, pleading word. A heavy silence fell. I saw the surprise on their faces shift – Mom’s eyes grew moist, Dad’s usual reserve cracked with a deep, thoughtful look. He finally met my anxious gaze, a sigh escaping him. “Top marks,” he murmured, his voice unusually soft. He glanced at Mom, who gave a tiny, tearful nod. A genuine smile touched his lips. “Alright then. Looks like we’re going to see your grandparents. Start packing.” Relief washed over me like a wave.

**Para 2: I saw my mom had tears in her eyes when leaving them.**
The week flew by in a blur of simple happiness at the old multi-story house and its sprawling gardens. Helping Grandma bake, listening to Grandpa’s tales, just being together felt like rediscovering a missing piece. As we packed the car to leave, heartfelt hugs were exchanged. Grandpa gruffly patted my back, Grandma pressed homemade cookies into my hands. Turning for one last wave, I saw them standing on the porch, looking smaller somehow. Then I noticed Mom. She stood by the car, gazing back at her parents. Sunlight caught the unmistakable tracks of tears on her cheeks. It wasn’t just sadness; it was a profound mix of love, regret for missed years, and the overwhelming realization of what this connection truly meant – the real treasure we’d almost forgotten.
